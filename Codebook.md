## Codebook
The requirements fo this assignment and the steps undertaken by me are as under:

 - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

 - From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Step wise process

- Download the data dn unzip it
- Had a look at the readme wordpad files ot understand and orient about the data
- Read the various files in the data - start with labels and then go on to look at the 2 datasets - Test and Train
- Merge the apples to apples data from Test and Train sets
- Adjusted the names of colums for readability
- Combining datasets
- Taking only measurements on mean and standard deviation
- Creating a econd independednt data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
- Saving the new data set to the local system
